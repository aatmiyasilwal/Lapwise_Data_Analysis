# Lapwise_Data_Analysis
Analyses Formula 1 Lap Data for every Grand Prix since the beginning of the 1996 season, generating distribution plots along the process.
Uses the Selenium Library for Web Scraping (from the Ergast API http://ergast.com/mrd/) and the Seaborn library to help visualize the data.
